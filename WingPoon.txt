Projects
* Domain Fine-Tuned, GPT-2 Auto-Completion Text Editor: A PoC context (2022 Russia-Ukraine War) fine-tuned, causal language-model editor for journalists who have to file reports from the field under difficult conditions and time pressures. Training corpus scraped using APIs. Authors need only type ~40% of the words they otherwise would have to.  [Hugging Face, Spacy, Curses, NYT API]
* Semi-Supervised Methods on Medical Datasets: Fully supervised approaches need large, densely annotated datasets. We utilized Self and Semi-Supervised Learning with Knowledge Distillation on pediatric pneumonia X-Rays to reduce the need for fully labeled data by ~95%. REST-API Web-App container deployed on GCP Cloud Run.  [TensorFlow, SimCLR, FixMatch, FastAPI, Bootstrap, Docker]
* Identifying Cancer using Computational Histopathology: Evaluate different machine-learning algorithms for identifying metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans. Investigate how hand-engineered Computer Vision features compare against Deep Learning's automatic feature-extraction.  [SK-Learn, SK-Image, TensorFlow, Dask, TPOT, PyOD]
